# Mushroom Classification

This is a project intended to classify different classes of mushroom using machine learning.

## Problem Statement

The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Mushrooms contains descriptions
of hypothetical samples corresponding to 23 species of gilled mushrooms in the
Agaricus and Lepiota Family Mushroom (1981). Each species is labelled as either
definitely edible, definitely poisonous, or maybe edible but not recommended. This last
category was merged with the toxic category. The Guide asserts unequivocally that
there is no simple rule for judging a mushroom's edibility, such as "leaflets three, leave it
be" for Poisonous Oak and Ivy.
The main goal is to predict which mushroom is poisonous & which is edible.
